# Finance Python CLI Programs

Welcome to the Finance Python CLI Programs repository! In this repository, I will be developing various Python command-line programs related to finance. These programs will cover a range of finance-related topics and may include calculations, analysis, and data manipulation.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/esconer/fincalc.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific program's directory:

   ```sh
   cd fincalc/folder-name/program-name
   ```

3. Run the program using Python:

   ```sh
   python payback_period.py
   ```

4. Follow the program's prompts and instructions to use it effectively.

## Programs

Here's a list of the programs currently available in this repository:

1. **Payback period calculator**: The Payback Period Calculator is a user-friendly Python application designed to help you quickly determine the payback period for your investment projects. Simply input your initial investment and expected cash flows, and the app will compute the time it takes for your investment to break even, providing a valuable insight into the project's profitability and risk assessment. Make informed financial decisions with ease using the Payback Period Calculator.


Each program is located in its own directory with its Python script and may include additional resources or documentation as needed.

## Future Plans

I have plans to expand this repository in the future:

- Develop GUI versions of the existing CLI programs for a more user-friendly experience.
- Add more finance-related programs covering various topics, such as investment analysis, budgeting, and more.
- Accept contributions from the open-source community to enhance the functionality and scope of the programs.
